How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

- 

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

- showing easy-to-understand versions of programming code in comparison to the (later) more advanced version
- to test if older versions don't produce a current bug

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

- more control of whats being saved (no redindancy)
- proper versioning (a specific version has specific described features)


Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

- multiple files might have been changed to achieve a specific functionality. In case of the need to downgrade to an older version (or just taking a look at it), linked files will also be altered

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

- advantage: choose the right amount of changes to justify a change/commit --> better structure ov versions...more sense
- disadvantage: committing could be forgotten, project members don't have the newest version to work on

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

- documents most of the time will be changed seperately, so there is no need to save multiple files 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
- nothing is irreversible anymore and the diff command "quickly" shows alterations to the code to find the bug easily


### notes ###
clone vs. copy -.-> with clone the history of changes to the directory or repository is copied.

### Linux shell commands ####
ls
ls -a # show files beginning with a dot,ex: ".git"
cd # jump to home directory


### GIT commands ###
git config --global color.ui auto #colored diff output

Compare two commits, printing each line that is present in one commit but not the other.
- git diff <commit_id_1> <commit_id_2>

Make a copy of an entire Git repository, including the history, onto your own computer.
- git clone <URL>

Temporarily reset all files in a directory to their state at the time of a specific commit.
- git checkout

Show the commits made in this repository, starting with the most recent.
- git log

repository anlegen
- git init <rep name>

View the Status of a repository...which changes have been made since the last commit
- git status
